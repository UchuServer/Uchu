# Scripting
Uchu has two scripting systems. These work as separate systems and serve different roles on the server.

## Python (Recommended)
Python is a higher level language which makes it fit the role of the primary user scripting language for Uchu.

### Python commands
* `/python-load <relative/path/to/script.py>` to load a script.
* `/python-unload <name>` to unload a running script. The script can hereafter be loaded again with changes.
* `/python-list` to list all running scripts.
* `/python <name> <...code...>` to run python code right through the game's chat window. `\n` and `\t` will be replaced with their character counterparts.

### Python scripting
A basic understanding of Python is recommended.

This document will not include every feature or concept in Uchu, only the most prevalent once.
Uchu's Python scripting is built with IronPython, which allows you to fully interact with the Uchu and .NET Core ecosystem.
So there are no limits to what can be scripted here.

#### WARNING: Do not run scripts you don't understand!
Scripts can do everything C# could, which means they could download stuff, install software, etc. So if you're given a script from someone,
make sure you understand what it does before loading it.

<hr>

#### Functions
Define these in your scripts and the server will call them at predictable times. These should normally act as the start point of your scripts.
```python
def load(): # called once when the script is loaded.

    # Setup the script here.

    pass

def tick(): # called every server tick cycle. The server aims for this to be 20 times per second.

    # Perform operations which should happen regularly here.

    pass

def unload(): # called once when the script is going to be unloaded.

    # Clean up everything related to the script here.

    pass
```

#### Server interactions
Uchu provides multiple resources to your scripts which they can utilize to interact with the server.

<hr>

##### Global Events
Events are a tool to hook up functions to be called when something happens.

###### Setup events
Binds a function to be called once a event is invoked. All of these functions return a `reference` you can use unbind the event.
* `OnStart(Object, function)` binds the function to being called when the Object is started.
* `OnDestroy(Object, function)` binds the function to being called when the Object is destroyed.
* `OnTick(Object, function)` binds the function to being called every server tick on the Object.
* `OnInteract(GameObject, function(player))` binds the function to being called when the GameObject is interacted with by a Player.
* `OnHealth(GameObject, function(health, delta, source-game-object))` binds the function to being called when the GameObject's health is changed.
* `OnArmor(GameObject, function(armor, delta, source-game-object))` binds the function to being called when the GameObject's armor is changed.
* `OnDeath(GameObject, function(smasher-game-object))` binds the function to being called when the GameObject is smashed.
* `OnChat(function(player, message))` binds the function to being called when a Player sends a chat message.

###### Release events
* `Release(reference)` unbinds a function from being called once a event is invoked.

<hr>

##### Global Methods
* `Drop(lot, position, source, owner)` drops an item for a player to pick up.
* `Currency(count, postion, source, owner)` drops coin for a player to pick up.
* `Chat(player, message)` sends a chat message to a player.
* `Broadcast(message)` broadcasts a chat message to every player in the zone.
* `Distance(vector_0, vector_1)` gets the distance between two Vector3 variables.
* `ClientContext()` returns an object allowing you to access the CDClient. See Uchu.Core/Client/CdClientContext.cs
* `UchuContext()` returns an object allowing you to access the server database. See Uchu.Core/Database/UchuContext.cs

<hr>

##### Global Properties

* `Layer` includes the standard layers included in calculating what objects should be shown to the player in the game world.
The bit operations on this mask are overwritten: `+=` adds a layer, `-=` removes a layer. `=` always sets the layer.
    * `Layer.None = 0`
    * `Layer.Default = 1`
    * `Layer.Environment = 1 << 1`
    * `Layer.Npc = 1 << 2`
    * `Layer.Smashable = 1 << 3`
    * `Layer.Player = 1 << 4`
    * `Layer.Enemy = 1 << 5`
    * `Layer.Spawner = 1 << 6`
    * `Layer.Hidden = 1 << 7` this layer should be used to hide objects from the players.
    * `Layer.All = (64-bit max value)`

<hr>

##### Zone

```

<hr>

##### Object
A Object is any object managed by the zone.

###### Methods
* `Start(Object)` makes the zone start managing this object. Call this on any new object when you're done setting it up. Will invoke the `OnStart` event.
    ###### Example
    ```python
    def new_game_object(lot, x, y, z):
        game_object = Create(lot, Vector3(x, y, z), Quaternion(0, 0, 0, 1))
  
        Start(game_object)
        Construct(game_object)
  
        return game_object
    ```
* `Destroy(Object)` removes this object from the zone's management. Will invoke the `OnDestroyed` event.

        restore_object(game_object, old_layer)

    def hide_object(game_object):
        old_layer = game_object.Layer
      
        game_object.Layer = Layer.Hidden
  
        return old_layer
  
    def restore_object(game_object, layer):

### Practical examples

#### Prop hunting
A small mini-game where players can hide as objects in the game world.

```python
hidden_players = []


def load():

    # Setup `parse_chat` to be called when a chat message is sent.
    OnChat(parse_chat)


def parse_chat(player, message):

    # Only accept commands
    if message[0] != '/':
        return

    global hidden_players

    # Interpret player commands
    param = message.split(' ')

    if param[0] == "/hide":

        # Check if player is already hidden
        for hidden in hidden_players:
            if hidden.player == player:

                # Send notice to the player
                Chat(player, "You are already hidden! Use the /reveal command to reveal yourself.")

                return

        # Get lot
        lot = int(param[1])

        # Setup prop
        prop = Prop(player, lot)

        prop.hide()

        # Send notice to the player
        Chat(player, "You hid yourself as " + str(lot) + "!")

        hidden_players.append(prop)
    elif param[0] == "/reveal":

        for hidden in hidden_players:
            if hidden.player == player:
                # Remove prop
                hidden.reveal()

                # Send notice to the player
                Chat(player, "You revealed yourself!")

                hidden_players.remove(hidden)

                return

        # Send notice to the player
        Chat(player, "You are already revealed! Use the /hide <lot> command to hide yourself.")
    elif param[0] == "/guess":
        guess(player)


def guess(player):
    global hidden_players

    # Send notice to the player
    Chat(player, "Guessing...")

    # Check if a player has correctly found a hiding prop.
    for prop in hidden_players:
        distance = Distance(prop.player.Transform.Position, player.Transform.Position)

        if distance < 5:
            prop.reveal()

            # Send notice to the player
            Chat(prop.player, "You were revealed!")

            hidden_players.remove(prop)


def unload():
    # Reveal all hidden players
    for hidden in hidden_players:
        hidden.reveal()


class Prop:
    def __init__(self, player, lot):
        self.player = player
        self.lot = lot
        self.layer = player.Layer
        self.obj = None

    def hide(self):
        # Hide the player
        self.player.Layer = Layer.Hidden

        transform = self.player.Transform

        # Create prop object
        self.obj = Create(self.lot, transform.Position, transform.Rotation)

        # Setup prop object
        Start(self.obj)
        Construct(self.obj)

    def reveal(self):
        # Restore layer
        self.player.Layer = self.layer

        # Destroy prop object
        Destroy(self.obj)
```

## C#
Uchu can load .NET Core assemblies at runtime to fulfill lower level scripting tasks.

### Setup
1. A .NET Core library with classes deriving form `Script`.
2. Build this library every time you make changes to the Uchu's code.
3. Add a tag `<ScriptDllSource>(Library name)</ScriptDllSource>` in between the `<DllSource></DllSource>` tags.

###### Note: these libraries cannot be reloaded once loaded. Requires server restart.
